 ## Using The Workbooks

 The workbooks are currently organized into separate folders for each rifle/cartridge combination.
 Note that this will change to organize them by cartridge, with a single workbook incorporating all rifles using that cartridge.

 Users are free to download the contents of this repository (if they have Git installed on their local systems) or download individual workbooks.
 If you download an individual workbook, you should also download the contents of the 'Code' folder, as this contains VBA code modules used by the workbooks.
