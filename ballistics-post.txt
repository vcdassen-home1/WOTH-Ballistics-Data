That's great. but are you going to look into how you display the HunterSense firing solution probable POI circle on the scope reticle?  It is especially noticeable in the Bushnell Elite Tactical Scope because it has that tactical MRAD reticle, with annotated numerical values on the major subtensions.

The issue as I see it is that the measured (elevation, windage) holdover values are too small if your in-game ballistics calculator's trajectory solutions are supposed to be on the same scale as what is shown in the trajectory graphs in the Encyclopedia / Ammunition pages.

If the reticle axes are calibrated in MILS in the above scope, then the major hashmarks (the ones with the numerical values) will be 1 MIL, 2 MIL, 3 MIL, 4 MIL, and so on.

Thus the smallest 1/4 division hash marks are spaced 0.25 MILS apart, the 1/2 division hash marks are spaced 0.5 MILS apart.

In the following, I'll use [SU] to refer to 'Scope Units'

In that case, the trajectory drop that I should get from my measurements would be calculated as:

[code]
      elevation[cm] 
          =  tan( elevationHoldover[mRad] * 1[rad]/1000[mRad] ) * (range[m] * (100[cm]/1[m])
          ~=  ( elevationHoldover * range / 100)  [cm], for angel[rads] close to 0

     Thus, 1MIL at 100 meters = 10cm of linear measure

    
      For the 300 Winchester Magnum/Terminal Ascent PHP ammunition:
             - 100m Zero Setting on the scope
             - 300m range to target
             - measured elevation holdover (position of HunterSense Dot) = -0.31 [SU]
     
       If that measurement is -0.31 MILS, then the trajectory drop I should expect is
              -0.31 * 300 / 10 [cm] = -9.30 cm,
[/code]

Are you telling me that the in-game trajectory drop is only -9.3 cm at 300m, whereas the encyclopedia page for this ammunition shows a drop of about -50 cm?

It appears as though I have to calculate the drop as 

[code]
      elevation[cm] = elevationHoldover[SU] * range[m]
	                = -0.31 * 300 = -93.0 [cm]
					
[/code]

That clearly isn't right either.  It's too large by a factor of 2.
It seems that the calculation should be
[code]
	elevation[cm] = elevationHoldover[SU] * range[m] * scaleFactor
[/code]
where scaleFactor is some numerical value, in the above case, about 0.5

My conclusion is that you have miscalibrated the scope reticle scale, as though the 1/4 divison hash marks are spaced 1.25MILS apart, a factor of 5.
That would give a trajectory drop for the above elevation as -46.5 cm, which would be about right.

I think the windage axis scale suffers from the same issue, although I haven't been able to determine the scale factor yet.
If this is the case, then the scopes are not using their full elevation and windage ranges, and you have compressed the display scale to the point where it is almost unusable for any reliable measurements.
No wonder I can't resolve elevation holdovers for ranges less than 50-75 meters apart, especially at ranges where the trajectory is within its maximum vertical extent.

It's not about measurement precision here - that should be reflected in the diameter of the HunterSense circles, so my precision will be on the order of +/- innerCircleDiameter/2.
For scope zero settings that range from 50 to 1000m meters, there is no need to artificially constrain the elevation of the HS dot to +/- 2 major units on the elevation axis.
Sure, you have no 'windage turret to dial', but we IRL shooters will almost never dial that turret anyway - that gets set once when a rifle is sighted in and the scope is zeroed.
We would dial the elevation turret adjust the trajectory, and holdover for the estimated wind.
In any case, if one is using HunterSense, it should show the true windage adjustment estimate for the given relative wind velocity vector and the range to target.  If that deflection is too large, then an experienced shooter would reduce the magnification accordingly.


As many of you know, I have been working on a project to measure the exterior ballistics of the new ammunition types for each rifle/cartridge combination, with the intent of using these results for shooting without HunterSense aiming at all.

An important aspect of this is understanding how the aiming system interprets the reticle hash mark values,

According to Bushnell's (downloadable) User Manual for this model, it is calibrated in  [i]milli-radians[/i](aka MRADS)

THE HORIZONTAL CROSSHAIR
The numerically designated MIL markings extend from
the center of the crosshairs outward to the right in 2 MIL
increments on the horizontal crosshair. The numbers
were removed on the left side of the reticle to keep the
reticle plane clean, but the reference points coincide
with the markings from the right side of the crosshair.
Measurements from the center point to the right are as
follows: 0.25 MIL, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0, 1.2, 1.5, 2.0, etc.

THE VERTICAL CROSSHAIR
The vertical crosshair places the numerically designated MIL markings on only the right side, like the horizontal crosshair.
Once again, the numerically designated markings are in 2 MIL increments with 0.25 MIL interval hash marks inside of 1
MIL and every 0.5 MIL interval outside of 1 MIL. The 11th MIL measurement down the reticle converts to 0.1 milling bars,
and the solid 0.25 MIL wide quick-acquisition bar starts at 30 MILS from the main horizontal stadia. The horizontal hashes
begin to elongate for windfall references, and floating dots are applied for additional holds without crowding the reticle
space to maintain the relatively clear appearance of the G-series design that familiar users know.

[/i]

But is this how the game's aiming system interprets the reticle calibration?

The answer is no - it multiplies the numerical values by 4, so that the first 0.25 MIL has mark is really 1.0 MILS, and so on.

I have confirmed this by using the shooting range in Nez Perce to make actual linear distance measurements:

Now, everything works as intended : shots will always land [i]somewhere[/i] in the estimated Point Of Impact circles, but...

The original scopes that come with the game do not have complex reticles capable of reliable, meaningful angular measurements - the scale does not matter.
However, when the new Bushnell scopes were introduced, we got calibrated reticles capable of decent measurements, and the scale discrepancy becomes apparent.  More than that, it makes the scope reticles practically useless.  

What reason could there be for this scale discrepancy?
