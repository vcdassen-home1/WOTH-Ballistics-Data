 ## Using The Workbooks

 The workbooks are currently organized into separate folders for each rifle/cartridge combination.
 Note that this will change to organize them by cartridge, with a single workbook incorporating all rifles using that cartridge.

 Users are free to download the contents of this repository by using the ZIP file link (see the Code drop-down button).
